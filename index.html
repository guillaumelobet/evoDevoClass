<div id="home">
  <h1>About Class</h1>
  <p> This class is about my favorite field of biology - evolutionary development, often nicknamed Evo-Devo. </p>
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> My name is <a href= "http://cierareports.org">Ciera Martinez</a>. My PhD work was on the evolution of plant shape, but have also been part of teams that have published evo-devo work exploring the evolution of wood, flowers, roots, and stems. I am now a Post-doctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley studying the evolution and patterning of <i>Drosophila</i> embryogenesis.
