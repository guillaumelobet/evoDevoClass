# Evolutionary Development (Evo Devo)
## Preparing for class

**Learning Objective**: At the end of analyzing this material you should be able to define the field of evolutionary development. 


1. Learn how to [reading a Phylogenetic Tree](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_05) - **5 min read**
2. Read the introduction section of the [wikipedia article on Evolutionary Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology). **5 min read**
3. Analyze each of these figures: Figure 1, Figure 2. **5 min each figure**
4. Read the article below on Diversification of Insect Morphology. The goal of this material is to understand one example of how Evo-Devo scientists approach a question.  You do not need to understand the details. **10 min read**

## Diversiﬁcation of insect wing morphology

Although all modern Winged insects bear two pairs of Wings, many structural, functional, and morphological differences exist between forewings and hindwings both Within and between species (Fig. 5.12). For example, the wings of dragonﬂies (Odonata) appear rather similar, but
the forewings of beetles (Coleoptera) have been modiﬁed into hardened coverings that protect the hindwings. Butterﬂy (Lepidoptera) forewings and hindwings are often of similar size, but have evolved different shapes and color patterns. In ﬂies (Diptera), the hindwing has been reduced to the haltere, a small balancing organ with a different biomechanical function.

The Ubx gene regulates the differences between forewing and hindwing patterns Within species. be is expressed in the developing hindwing of all insects studied, and it controls hindwing-speciﬁc patterning (Fig. 5.15). Yet, the hindwings of different insects such as butterﬂies, beetles, and ﬂies are all different from one another. This diversity reflects the regulation by be of different sets of target genes in each animal.

Recall that in the Drosophila haltere, be represses the wing-patterning genes that are
required for the growth and ﬂattening of the wing and for the development of wing veins and
sensory organs (see Chapter 5). By contrast, be does not repress the orthologs of these genes in the butterﬂy. The butterﬂy hindwing is large and ﬂat, and it has similar venation and
sensory organ patterning to the forewing; the developmental program that controls these features is deployed in both wing pairs. In certain butterﬂies, be regulates target genes that lements, scale pigmentation, and scale morphology.

All features that have no counterpart in the fruit ﬂy. Thus the homologous hindwings of ﬂies and butterﬂies have evolved distinct morphologies in part because of independent changes in the regulatory connections between be and genes in the Wing hierarchy (Fig- 5-14).

The evolution of developmental responses to environmental cues has also contributed to the regulation and evolution 0f insect Wing morphology and number. For example, in ants reproductive ind1v1duals have Wings While the worker and soldier castes are Wingless. This

promote Wing development may underlie the evolution of wing polyphenism in ants. Due to the modular nature of the wing developmental hierarchy, such evolutionary changes in Cis'regulatory elements may alter Wing formation and morphology in some developmental programs without disrupting Wing development entirely.
